# A RateLimiter handles HTTP rate limits for controller actions. Rate limits are
# based on the user, the user's IP, and the controller action.
#
# A RateLimiter is backed by RateLimit objects stored in the database, which
# track the rate limits with a token bucket algorithm. A RateLimiter object
# usually has two RateLimits, one for the current user and one for their IP.
