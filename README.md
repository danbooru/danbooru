## Quickstart

### Using Github Codespaces

To launch a Danbooru instance in your browser:

1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/signup).
2. Click [Open in Github Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/danbooru/danbooru?quickstart=1).
3. Click the `Create new codespace` button.
4. Wait a few minutes for it to launch.

When it's done, you'll have a new Danbooru instance with a full development environment running in your browser. This way you can try out Danbooru without installing anything on your computer.

See the [Codespaces section](https://github.com/danbooru/danbooru/wiki/Docker-Guide#user-content-running-in-github-codespaces) in the [Docker Guide](https://github.com/danbooru/danbooru/wiki/Docker-Guide) to learn more.

### Using Docker

Run this to start a Danbooru instance:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danbooru/danbooru/master/bin/setup)"
```

This will install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and start Danbooru. When it's done, Danbooru will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Alternatively, if you already have Docker Compose installed, you can do:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/danbooru/danbooru
cd danbooru
touch .env.local config/danbooru_local_config.rb
sudo docker compose up
```

When you're done, you can run the following to delete everything:

```sh
sudo docker compose down --volumes # Delete all data and images in your Danbooru instance.
sudo docker image prune            # Clean up all unused Docker images.
rm -rf ~/danbooru                  # Delete the Danbooru code.
```

## Installation

See the [Docker Guide](https://github.com/danbooru/danbooru/wiki/Docker-Guide) for more information on running Danbooru using Docker. This is the recommended way to run Danbooru.

Alternatively, you may use the [Manual Installation Guide](https://github.com/danbooru/danbooru/wiki/Manual-Installation-Guide) to install Danbooru without Docker. Manual installation is much more difficult than using Docker, and therefore is not recommended or officially supported.
