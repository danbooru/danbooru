          In order to draw this picture, I used a drawing method called the Grizaille method.

          In this method, you first shade in monotone and then apply a colormap to it.

          By doing so, you can do a harmonious shading overall.

          各位我來遲了，這是十月的第二個獎勵與第三個獎勵的WIP 山中井野和耳郎響香(wip)

          *如各位所見，十一月所剩時間不多加上十一月底我要跟家人出去旅行一小段時間，因此十一月獎勵又將暫停一次，我會暫停系統十二月的收款。 如果你是十一月才加入，等我把十月獎勵都完成之後會一起上架至到商店。(上架短時間會與patreon價格相同)

          我知道我的時間控管很差，謝謝每一位願意支持我的人。
